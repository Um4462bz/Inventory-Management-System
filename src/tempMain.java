 * This information system is popular in multiple businesses, where we need to control product inventory stocking and purchasing.
 *  In this project, you will manage various products and warehouses. Each warehouse will stock a different set of products. You 
 *  need to have a user-friendly form to manage the general product information (add, modify, delete) and another form to manage 
 *  each warehouse's inventory stock. Another form to enter product order verifies if each product has enough inventory (quantity). 
 *  If the product order is approved, the inventory of those ordered products is updated.
